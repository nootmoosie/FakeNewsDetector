# FakeNewsDetector
This repo contains the Kaggle fake news dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data, and files for a classifier to use on this data.

The classifier uses pre-trained word embeddings, which are not included in this repo due to the size of the file. To run the files in the repo, the word embeddings file will have to be downloaded (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM) and added into the code directory.
